# Squishy's Server
 A repo for the Squishy's Server Lua Mod for sm64ex-coop, with the main goal to make my hosts have everything you would need quality of life wise!

 This repo is a resource if you're curious about how something in the mod is coded, Want to make optimization Pull Requests, or just hate long loading times and just want to download it here.

## Downloading to avoid loading times

 If you're here to download the latest version of the server mod, then follow these intructions:

 Under *"Code"* press **"Download ZIP"**. Take the folder *"squishys-server-main"* within the zip and place it under **"mods"** in your game's AppData (Like you would any other mod). Once the folder is moved, rename it from **"squishys-server-main"** to **"squishys-server"** *(Just removing "-main")*. Relaunch the game and attempt to join me, if done successfully you should join instantly!

 If that doesn't work, clear/delete your **"mod.cashe,"** relaunch the game, and try again.
